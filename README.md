# PatikaStore Inventory Management System



An admin panel simulation in which a user can perform several operations. Some of these operations include adding, removing, or listing products.

## Goal of this exercise

## Admin Panel Structure

- The user is prompted with options and can choose which action to perform.
- The user is given different options depending on the type of the product they want to deal with and can browse through different menus to complete desired actions.
